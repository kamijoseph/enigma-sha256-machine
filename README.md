# 🔐 Enigma-Sim

 

Enigma-Sim is a Python-based emulator of the legendary WWII Enigma machine — enhanced with SHA-256 encrypted settings to modernize its cryptographic principles. Built for education, fun, and to show off in your portfolio.

## 🕰️ A Brief History 

The Enigma machine was used by Nazi Germany to encrypt military messages during World War II. At its peak, it was believed to be unbreakable — until Allied codebreakers, including Polish mathematicians and British cryptanalyst Alan Turing, cracked it. That breakthrough shifted the tide of the war and laid the groundwork for modern computing and cybersecurity.

This project is an educational re-creation of the Enigma, designed for software engineers and cryptography enthusiasts. No political ideologies are endorsed — this is a tribute to the power of mathematics, logic, and code.

# 💡 Why This Project Exists

As a portfolio project, Enigma-Sim was built to:

Recreate and modernize a historically significant cryptographic device

Practice real Python packaging and modular design

Provide a CLI + API cipher tool usable in modern workflows

Just look damn cool on GitHub and PyPI 😎

## Installation and Usage

```bash

git clone https://github.com/kamijoseph/enigma-sha256-machine.git

cd enigma-sim

pip install
```


## 🚀 Usage

🔹 CLI Mode

Run from the terminal:

```bash

enigma_sim

```

or

```
python -m enigma_sim.cli

```

## 🧪 Testing

To run tests :

```
pytest tests/
```

## 🧠 Fun Fact

The original Enigma machine had over 150 quintillion possible configurations — but human error (not algorithmic weakness) was its downfall. Turing didn’t brute force it — he outsmarted it.
